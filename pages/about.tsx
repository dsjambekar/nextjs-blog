			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>Hello world!</p>
			<p>My name is Dhanashree Jambekar. I am a software developer from India.<br /><br />I started my career in .Net technology with WPF and windows applications. Then I moved to MVC. And now I am learning React.</p>
			<p>This blog is going to be about that. I am going to '<a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public">learn in public</a>'.</p>
			<p>But it is not going to be just about that. I might also write some bits about my personal experiences.Â </p>
			<p>My hobbies are casual reading, casual writing, listening to music and gardening.<br />I enjoy watching movies/series that have interesting stories and/or cute actors :)<br />While doing anything, you will find me humming any random song that is on my mind at that moment.</p>
			<p>I also make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1pYbZdpfIS3sdF0fsiEOFg/videos?view_as=public">YouTube videos</a> for elderly audience to explain them SmartPhone features. (They are in my mother tongue Marathi.)</p>
			<p>As I grow old, I hope to be a better programmer and contribute my share to programming community.</p>
